# Perceptron Model
Understanding the simplest Perceptron Model.

#### DESCRIPTION
Urine specimens were analyzed in an effort to determine if certain physical characteristics of the urine might be related to the formation of calcium oxalate crystals.

This data frame contains the following columns:
1. r - Indicator of the presence of calcium oxalate crystals.
2. gravity - The specific gravity of the urine.
3. ph - The pH reading of the urine.
4. osmo - The osmolarity of the urine. Osmolarity is proportional to the concentration of molecules in solution.
5. cond - The conductivity of the urine. Conductivity is proportional to the concentration of charged ions in solution.
6. urea - The urea concentration in millimoles per litre.
7. calc - The calcium concentration in millimoles per litre.
